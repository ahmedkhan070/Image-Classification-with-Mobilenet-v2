### Flower Image Classification using Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

**Project Overview**
This project aims to classify flower images into five categories: roses, daisy, dandelion, sunflowers, and tulips. A transfer learning approach is employed using Google's TensorFlow Hub MobileNetV2 model as the base. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the flower dataset to achieve efficient and accurate classification.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of flower images categorized into five folders corresponding to the flower types.

**Methodology**
1. **Import Necessary Libraries:** Imports essential libraries like TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, Keras, OpenCV, etc.
2. **Load and Preprocess Data:** Loads the flower dataset, performs necessary preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization), and splits data into training, validation, and test sets.
3. **Load Pre-trained Model:** Loads the MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow Hub.
4. **Fine-tune Model:** Freezes the base model layers, adds custom classification layers, and compiles the model for training.
5. **Training:** Trains the model on the flower dataset.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Sample Prediction:** Demonstrates how to use the trained model to classify individual flower images.

**Key Points**
* **Transfer Learning:** Leverages the power of pre-trained models to accelerate training and improve performance.
* **MobileNetV2:** Utilizes a lightweight and efficient architecture for image classification.
* **Fine-tuning:** Adapts the pre-trained model to the specific task of flower classification.
* **Sample Prediction:** Provides a practical example of using the trained model.

**Dependencies**
* TensorFlow
* TensorFlow Hub
* Keras
* OpenCV (optional, for image processing)
* Other necessary libraries

**Note:** This README will be updated as the project progresses.

**Additional Information**
* Detailed explanations and comments are included within the Jupyter Notebook.
